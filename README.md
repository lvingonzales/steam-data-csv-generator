## Why I did this?
For a graphic design assignment on Data Visualization with a somewhat large dataset, I decided to look at data on my own top 50 most played (via Hours of Playtime) games.  
This required me to create a file with all of the data as part of a Document submission, and I felt it would be a fun exercise to create a tool to automate the process and save myself some time.
